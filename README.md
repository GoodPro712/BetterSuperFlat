##This is currently implemented really bad

That being said it does the following:

- Void in all three dimensions
- Has all the biomes and structures of vanilla generation included
- Overworld generates glass floor with outlines for chunks

Problems:
- The generation glass floor generation is slow
- Currently doesnt change the gamerules to default to good ones
- Player spawns at y63 not y1
- Everything below y 63 is dark because of the sea level is as in vanilla
